Notes on each trial run of data collection

###### 07/25/19 Perroni Bottle
- Perroni bottle, in the freezer door.  This time I made the screen saver never go on, and the laptop never sleep, and the piping was not broken in the entire run.  This is a full successful run with the ambient temperature sensor.

###### 07/24/19 Perroni Bottle
- Perroni bottle, in the freezer door, first trail with portabl battery and ambient temperature reading.  Beverage was very warm.  The pipe streaming broke a few times in the recording due to what I think was the laptop going to sleep after 15 min.

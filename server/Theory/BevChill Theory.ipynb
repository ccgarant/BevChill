    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "It is unknown how long it will take my room temperature beverage, if put the beverage in the freezer or refridgerator, to chill down to the 'perfect' drinking temperature, or at the very least a 'good enough' drinking temperture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: It's Friday, on your way home from work you stop at the beer store and pick out a package of beer.  It's room temperature.  When you arrive home, you throw a few beers in the freezer.  About how long should you wait until they are 'cold enough' to grab.  About how long should you wait until they are 'perfect' to drink.  When will they start to freezer?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "To develope a 'beverage chill timer' that approximates the beverage's tempertaure as it is cooling in a freezer or refridgerator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on real physics and engineering of heat transfer theory, estimate how long a certain beverage type needs to chill before reaching its 'ideal drinking temperature'.  This approximation shall take into account various starting initial condition.  Verify the approximation predicts reality with emperical testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "From Heat Transfer Theory Ref [1], the approach of __*Thermal Resistance*__ has been chosen.  This approach is a conservation of energy approach that models the energy lost from the closed system as a resistance.  That is, if the heat transfers well thru say metal, the resistance of retaining heat energy is low.  In contrast, glass does not dissipate heat as well as metal, and therefore has a higher thermal resistance than metal.\n"

    "If the beer bottle is treated as a closed system from the initial conditions of being in equilibrium with the atmospheric temperature Tatm , and treating t0 as the starting time once placed in the refrigerator, the thermal mass has a stored energy which will be taken away by the cooler refrigerator conditions.

See Figure 1 and Figure 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assumptions in the thermal resistance model are (1) one-dimensional heat transfer in the radial direction, (2) heat transfer from the top and bottom of the bottle is negligible, (3) the bottle label is ignored.  These assumptions can be included in a more detailed analysis, but for our purposes are sufficient.\n",
